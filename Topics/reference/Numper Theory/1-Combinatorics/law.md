k^n :- getting all probabilities of n opjects with k values.

P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)! :- calculates the number of permutations of choosing 'k' objects out of 'n' without repetition, where order matters.

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n âˆ’ k)!):- calculates the number of combinations of choosing 'k' objects out of 'n' without repetition, where order doesn't matter.
