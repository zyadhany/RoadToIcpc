- The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)~--- number of testcases.

- Since this number can be very large, count it \textbf{modulo} $10^9 + 7$.

- subarray
    - A subarray of an array is a contiguous sequence of elements within that array. For example, if we have an array $[1, -2, 3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]$, then some of its subarrays include $[1, -2, 3]$, $[4, -1, 2, 1]$, and $[-5, 4]$.
